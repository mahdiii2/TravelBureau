# Travel Bureau Frontend

This Next.js app uses Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components for styling. It provides two pages:
- `/home` displays hotel contracts and includes an Upload Data button.
- `/jobs` lists uploaded contract jobs.

Run `npm run dev` from the `frontend` folder to start the development server.
